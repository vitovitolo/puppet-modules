# /etc/init.d/varnish expects the variables $DAEMON_OPTS, $NFILES and $MEMLOCK

# Note: If systemd is installed, this file is obsolete and ignored.  You will
# need to copy /lib/systemd/system/varnish.service to /etc/systemd/system/ and
# edit that file.

# Should we start varnishd at boot?  Set to "no" to disable.
